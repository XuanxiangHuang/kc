\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
%
Compiling propositional formulas into tractable circuits has been extensively studied,
with particular emphasis on structured languages such as \emph{structured} DNNF or SDD,
where a \emph{vtree} globally constrains decomposability, and OR nodes
ensure determinism. These restrictions guarantee strong closure properties and
tractable queries, but often lead to large circuit sizes.

In contrast, \emph{plain DNNF} requires only decomposability,
without enforcing a global variable order.
Such representations can be exponentially more succinct.
Our goal is therefore:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Problem:} Given a CNF formula $\phi$ over variables $\mbf{V}$,
compile $\phi$ into an \emph{unstructured DNNF}, i.e.,
a circuit where all AND-nodes are decomposable but
no global vtree is required and OR-nodes may be non-deterministic.
